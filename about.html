                        <p>The 3PL logistics sectors estimated annual growth of 20% is primarily driven by the growing trend to outsource supply chain logistics functions.</p>
                        <p>VPI has developed global networks, by establishing our own operations in key geographies, and by forming alliance partnerships with complimentary service providers. VPI facilitates an extension of the enterprise, providing detailed knowledge of various logistics markets, including transportation, logistics and regulatory issues. Critical information related to storage and distribution, international customs documentation, multi-modal freight rates and preferential trade terms is compiled and processed.</p>
                        <p>In addition to providing expertise, a key to managing the complexities of a global supply chain with regulatory and other issues, we are able to leverage infrastructure and freight rate negotiations over a large base, providing cost advantages. Additionally, for customers experiencing seasonal demand for their product, outsourcing the logistics function transforms a fixed cost into a variable. This can have a significant benefit to the bottom line.</p>
                        <p>In a study performed by Ernst & Young and the University of Tennessee, organizations using 3PL companies reduced logistics costs by an average of 7.8%; achieved a reduction in logistics assets of 21.6% and a reduction in order cycle time from 6.3 to 3.5 days.</p>

                        <p>The growing emphasis on information technology, a key enabler in an information intensive global economy, has created challenges as well as opportunities in the area of supply chain logistics. The majority of large corporations have already invested in large enterprise systems (ERP) and are increasingly requiring their supply chain logistics partners to interface with them, facilitating an integrated information flow throughout the supply chain. 3PL providers have responded to this challenge, forming alliances with independent software companies or developing information technology internally. This has in turn created a market for software vendors, who have responded with suites of Supply Chain Execution (SCE) applications. This includes order management systems (OMS), warehouse management systems (WMS) and transportation management systems (TMS).</p>
                        <p>VPI is able to optimize storage, distribution and transportation networks, track shipments across multiple transportation modes and execute transactions electronically. The use of electronic data interchange (EDI) has been extensively applied, providing opportunities for value added solutions providers in this area. Traditionally this exchange of data has been based on traditional trade and transportation documentation, with standardized transaction sets being exchanged by business partners.</p>
                        <p>Costs associated with this exchange in many cases precluded the participation of smaller customers, necessitating the manual input of data into logistics systems. The utilization of the Internet, in universal fashion has changed everything. It is now possible to link all logistics partners, no matter how small, providing real time information flows on a global scale.</p>
